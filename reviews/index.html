        "body":"The owner was extremely informative during the estimation process, and always responsive to every question I had. More importantly, his expertise and professionalism made me feel comfortable after I had had 2 different roofs from 2 different companies that leaked. Because of my hesitancy to get another roof, I had gotten 4 different estimates. But Zenith offered the clearest itemization and best value for a good product, since I have a flat roof and needed a reliable product with a strong guarantee. Some firms made me feel pressured, but Zenith's owner made me feel confident in his knowledge and experience. Lastly, the crew manager and workers put in consistent effort and kept me informed. They were respectful of my property, and very pleasant to work with. Each stage was completed in the time frame as promised, and I did not feel I was being hit with up-charges since all aspects of the process had been well laid-out and upfront. Roofing is not always predictable until the old roof is removed, especially since my home is 70+ years old, but Zenith was very forthright with all information at every stage of the job.",

I got four quotes, and Bryan's was one of the most reasonable - and he was prepared to start the work almost immediately, a great benefit since we wanted to get the work done (if possible) before we left toward the end of March. Bryan's team (especially Omar, the team lead) did outstanding work: they were extremely flexible in dealing with the rainy weather, even working on weekends when rain precluded working on some week days; Omar was extremely helpful and accommodating to our solar panel company in dealing with their removal of the panels before the roof work and reinstallation afterwards - ensuring that little time was lost in the process; and the Zenith team was very careful, thorough, and professional in their work, including in the removal of debris and cleaning up afterwards. Bryan was also a pleasure to work with and very accommodating whenever anything came up. We were extremely pleased with their work, and would highly recommend this company to anyone.",

My wife and I bought our home about six months ago and have absolutely marathoned a complete renovation, from foundation work to a new roof and everything in between. This was our first time undertaking such an endeavor and we learned a lot along the way; notably that contractors can be an absolute menace to your sanity. Not only having to stay on top of them to get work done in a timely manner, but almost micromanage the details so that work is done right. Hiring Zenith was the total opposite experience. They were timely, professional, hard working and so attentive to the needs of our home and our family that my wife and I just want everyone to have that same kind of experience. Thank you, most notably, to Bryan who was our main point of contact and oversaw the whole process. We shopped roofers and not only was Zenith the best value, but they blew us away with their incredible customer service from beginning to end. Thank you again!",

Brian of Zenith answered my call and agreed to come to my house today between 12:00 and 1:00 pm to give me an estimate. Well, this guy never showed up. I waited from 11:45 am to 1:15 pm at the house. It is unethical to conduct business this way. I never understood how Zenith Roofing could get a 5-star rating for displaying such unethical conduct. If you do not intend to come, just say so. Don't waste customer's time by not showing up. I am really disappointed. This tells us something about the way Zenith Roofing runs and conducts business.\n\nOwner response (same day): apologized and noted it was during rain season and a human error—‘not customary to no-show.’",

I did my due diligence before deciding on Zenith Roofing and I could not be more pleased with my decision. I am 100% satisfied with their workmanship. Every step of the process was handled professionally, courteously, and promptly. I had a million questions and a lot of uncertainty about what approach would be best for me, my budget, and my home. The business owner/contractor, Bryan Ramirez, is highly knowledgeable and patient. He provided me with several options, including detailed explanations of the pros and cons of each, and patiently waited for me to think them through and ask more questions as they came up; importantly, he did not pressure me into moving faster than I was comfortable moving. His crew was also extremely prompt, efficient and experienced. They operated in unison like a smooth, well-oiled machine. They also cleaned up everything. Bryan also made sure that I was comfortable with costs. This is my first public review, but it was important for me to take the time to share my experiences. 100% - Zenith Roofing was the right local company for my job.",

As I began looking for contractors, Zenith Roofing Services happened to start work on a house 2 doors from us. I got the benefit of watching as the crew worked on the neighbor's home, and I liked what I saw. I requested an estimate and was pleased to see the level of detail presented in the proposal (as opposed to other contractors), and at a fair price. I signed with Zenith Roofing for our roofing project and am extremely happy with the results. This job included 28 solar panels that needed to be removed, then re-installed. Zenith Roofing was fantastic in coordinating with the solar contractor so that our project stayed on schedule, and with no cost surprises. I plan to continue to use them for regular maintenance inspections to keep things in good working order. I highly recommend Zenith Roofing Services."},
